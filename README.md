jquery-color-field
==================


jquery-color-field is a light plugin for intuitive color selection. 
It's nice to color code stuff, but it should only add to the users experience. 
This plugin is an attempt at a sublte method for closing the gap between the entity the color is related to and the selection of that color.


## Usage
See jquery.colorfield.html for examples
